```
hold up it's the
motherfuckin' concrete
suicidal nightshift
loaded with a vice grip
poppin' all you copies
who keep waterin' down shit
thinking you can rap with
that artificial outfit
your baggy pants and
bottle of crack hits
fuck all of that shit
fuck all of you posers
let go of the mic kid
step into a world that
you've never seen
when i'm fiening for
a microphone
i'm a microphone fiend
<♪>
bring on the
motherfuckin' cutthroat
territorial piss off
spit the deadly and
ready for lift-off
who's getting their
shit tossed
is it the one kid
running his mouth
that he's sucking
his thumb with
you're damn straight
i'll put it right in 'em
no anti-venom
for the buck-buck
see a world that
you've never seen
when I'm fiening
for a microphone
i'm a microphone fiend
<♪>

mic y'all

give me a mic so i can
rock it right y'all

when i'm blowin' up
the mic y'all you know it
<♪>
hold up check out
the motherfuckin' tv
same song same bands
everyday fuck that
i'll blow those
motherfuckers away you wantin'
to hear some heavy ass
metal that can
penetrate deep
into you ear drums
trun it up motherfucker
turn it up motherfucker
turn it up and step
into a world that
you've never seen
when i'm fiening
for a microphone
i'm a microphone fiend
<♪>
give me a
motherfuckin' mic y'all
give me a mic y'all
give me a mic so i can
rock it right y'all
